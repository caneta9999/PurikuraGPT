# PurikuraGPT
Code created with ChatGPT to make a Purikura app and test ChatGPT capability. <br/>
> In Japan, purikura (プリクラ) refers to a photo sticker booth or the product of such a photo booth. The name is a shortened form of the registered Atlus/Sega trademark Print Club (プリント倶楽部, Purinto Kurabu), the first purikura machine, introduced to arcades in 1995. [[source]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photo_booth#Purikura).

The code tries to simulate it, taking 4 pictures and making a 2x2 grid at the end. <br/>
I added inputs to ChatGPT for him to code and tweak and he did. So credits to the AI that was responsible for the code. <br/>
I was inspired by these two videos: [Can AI code Flappy Bird? Watch ChatGPT try](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8y7GRYaYYQg) and [Can AI Code Minecraft? Watch ChatGPT Try](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXnIyRILSkg)
